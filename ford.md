# Fortran package manager developer documentation

This is the main documentation of the Fortran Module **M_history**

The code includes routines normally found in additional modules so
that it can be used as a stand-alone routine. The same module when part
of the General Purpose Fortran repository is dependent on the modules
M_journal(3f) and M_strings(3f).

## Command line interface

*M_history(3f)* is mainly used as a component of a command line tool.
It provides a simple input-line recall and edit capability, commonly
called an input history editor that does not require or use terminal
escape sequences.  It just uses a simple line editor model based on the
CDC xedit editor commands `change` and `modif`.
