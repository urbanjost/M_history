# M_history
A Fortran subroutine called redo(3f) may be used to give a line-mode
command history to interactive programs.
## BUILDING
    git clone https://github.com/urbanjost/M_history.git
    cd M_history/src
    # change Makefile if not using gfortran(1)
    make
This will compile the M_history module and build the example program 
in the PROGRAMS/ sub-directory.
