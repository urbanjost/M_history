# M_history

A Fortran subroutine called redo(3f) may be used to give a line-mode
command history to interactive programs.

    git clone https://github.com/urbanjost/M_history.git
    cd M_history/src
    # change Makefile if not using gfortran(1)
    make

This will compile the M_history module and build all the example programs from
the document pages in the PROGRAMS/ sub-directory.
